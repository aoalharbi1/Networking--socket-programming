Design Sketch: program3-client


Program Requirements:

The client sends an operation code(opcode) and c-string to the server.  The opcode 
describes how the server should modify the string. The server modifies the string and then 
returns it to the client where it is displayed.  The server has no command line input and 
no console output.  The server must terminate when it receives SIGTERM. The client has one 
command line input, the name of the machine where the server is running.The  client  must 
have  a  basic  interface  that  prompts  the  user  for  the  desired action and the string.
You must include an exit menu command in the client interface

Program Inputs:

The client will receive an input from command line that is the address of the server. It is also
going to receive two inputs from the user which are the choice from the menu and their message.

Program Outputs:

The client is going to display a menu of operations to do on the string which the user inputs. Additionally,
it will output the string after the server modifies it.

Test Plan:

Run the server then test if the client connects to it.
After the client is connected to the server, test if the string is modified correctly.
Test with a string that is longer than 128 characters to see if the client and the server 
detects the error.

Solution Overview:

Ask the user to choose one of the operation from a menu. Then, ask the user to enter
the message. Then, send it to the server which performs the operation specified in the 
opcode of the packet. Finally, the server sends back a packet and the client displays it.
