Design Sketch: program3-client


Program Requirements:

The client sends an operation code(opcode) and c-string to the server.  The opcode 
describes how the server shouldmodify the string. The server modifies the string and then 
returns it to the clientwhere it is displayed.  The server has no command line input and 
no consoleoutput.  The server must terminate when it receives SIGTERM. The client hasone 
command line input, the name of the machine where the server is running.The  client  must 
have  a  basic  interface  that  prompts  the  user  for  the  desiredaction and the string.
You must include an exit menu command in the client interface


Program Inputs:

A packet from the client

Program Outputs:

A packet to the client

Test Plan:

Run the server then test if the client connects to it. After the client is connected to the
server, test if the string is modified correctly. Test with a string that is longer than 
128 characters to see if the client and the server detects the error. Finally, check if
the server will terminate with "pkill"

Solution Overview:

Allow a client to be connected to the server. The client will send a packet (4 characters opcode,
128 characters payload). The server validate the packet. If it is valid, it performs the 
requested operation then sends the packet back to the client. The sevrer will remain up 
until it gets a signal.
